### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security issue **do not open an issue**, instead [report a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) in the **Security > Advisories** tab.
